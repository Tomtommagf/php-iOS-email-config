# Description
This project is a proof of concept on how to generate a customized iOS profile.
With the profile, you may easily configure your email account on an iOS device such as an iPhone or iPad.

# Setting Up
## Editing the Configuration File
Open the `.mobileconfig` file in any text editor. Please note that it's basically an XML file. Modify it accordingly, if you must.
Leave the field values `DISPLAYNAME` and `MAILADDR` as is, except if `IncomingMailServerUsername` and `OutgoingMailServerUsername` are supposed to differ from the email address. If so, you may have to modify both the PHP code and the XML-formatted file.

It may be necessary to modify the hostnames, ports and whether the connection shall be made over SSL/TLS. While modifying, you may search for the term "example" (case insensitive).

## Editing the PHP Code
Now open the PHP file in any text editor. Add an array of trusted domains in `TRUSTEDDOMAINS`.

Note that the PHP code assumes that the email addresses will be formatted as `jane.doe@example.com` for a person named "Jane Doe". So the `DISPLAYNAME` will be set accordingly.

# Usage
Once you have set up as described above, upload the files to your webserver and call the HTML page. That's it.

# Compatibility
This method should be compatible with any Apple devices with iOS 5, iPadOS 13.1 or later versions. The functionality was tested with iOS 14.
